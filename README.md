Developed an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution using Microsoft Power BI to analyze, visualize, and interpret large datasets for decision-making. The project involved data extraction, transformation, modeling, and visualization, resulting in interactive dashboards that provided actionable business insights.

The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor, where missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data formats were handled efficiently. Created a robust data model by establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.

Implemented DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns, measures, KPIs, and time-intelligence metrics such as Year-over-Year growth, Month-over-Month trends, cumulative totals, and averages. Designed visually appealing and interactive dashboards using charts, tables, slicers, filters, and drill-through features to enable dynamic data exploration.

The dashboards allowed stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify trends and patterns, compare performance across categories, and make data-driven business decisions. Performance optimization techniques such as removing unnecessary columns, optimizing relationships, and reducing data load were applied to improve report efficiency.
